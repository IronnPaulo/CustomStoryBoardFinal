      "description": "Seriously. By witnessing the beauty and awe of the sunset, you can slow down your perception of time. According to 2012 research, participants who felt awe — defined as “the emotion that arises when one encounters something so strikingly vast that it provokes a need to update one’s mental schemas” — felt like they had more time available and were less impatient. “Experiences of awe bring people into the present moment,” researchers wrote in the paper, “which underlies awe’s capacity to adjust time perception, influence decisions, and make life feel more satisfying than it would otherwise.”

Feel like there aren’t enough hours in the day? Amazingly, by taking the time to gaze out into the vast, color-soaked sky, we’re actually empowering ourselves to regain control of the clock.",
