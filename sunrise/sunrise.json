      "description": "Sunrise When you see the sunrise or sunset, chances are that it will put you in a better mood. It actually has been proven to relieve stress and have many physical benefits, so, if you are having a rough day, drive to your favorite spot and watch your worries wash away. The colors the sun creates against the sky can be truly amazing. Take advantage of the painting it gives you and appreciate it. Not to mention, it makes for pretty fantastic pictures. Snap a few photos, but remember to also be present with the sunset/sunrise, you won't regret it. ",
